# Generic Node Sensor Edition (GNSE)

## About

LoRaWAN promised you roaming, secure and low-cost sensors that last on a battery for years. _Generic Node_ platform delivers this promise with additional strong end to end encryption and firmware over the air update in a device with multiple sensors that can be configured and programmed to support many use cases.

This repository contains all the necessary hardware and software files for the GNSE LoRaWAN node. The core of the system is based off the STM32WL55xx dual-core LoRaWAN SOC.
