 * Although there is a duty cycle restriction which allows to transmit for only a portion of time on a channel,
 * there are also additional policies enforced by networks to prevent interference and quality degradation for transmission.
 *
 * For example TTN enforces uplink of 36sec airtime/day and 10 downlink messages/day. Demo sends 1 byte of unconfirmed uplink,
 * using a default data rate of DR_0 (SF = 10, BW=125Khz) for US915, so airtime for each uplink ~289ms, hence setting the interval
 * to 700 seconds to achieve maximum air time of 36sec per day.
